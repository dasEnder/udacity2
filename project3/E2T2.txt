Low	 	"On instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd, process 'python3' is listening on UDP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet"
Low		"On instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd, process 'python3' is listening on TCP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet"
Low 	"On instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd, process 'python3' is listening on TCP port 5000 which is reachable from the internet"
==> restric access to the port using firewall and security group allowing access only through the ELB.
Medium	Instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd  is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
==> either remove SSH access and move towards inmutable instance; or remove user/password auth mechanism. 
Medium	"Instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack."
==> remove the possibility of ssh using root.
Medium	"No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts."
==> set passwords rules in the instance, or remove the possibility to ssh the instance.
Medium	Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd in your assessment target.
==> set passwords rules in the instance, or remove the possibility to ssh the instance.
Medium	"On instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet"
Medium	"On instance i-08c4242d3a9a1a9cd, process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet"
==> remove the possibility to ssh the instance by creating inmutable instance, or use bastion, VPN, or Systems Manager.
