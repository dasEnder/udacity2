# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
TFsec: scans terraform files. It can be use in the local dev env, or in the CI env dev/test

### Example vulnerability

 Use over permissive CIDR (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0). No use of TLS for HTTP. AWS keys in the TF files 

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Docker scan: Vulnerability scanning for Docker local images allows teams to review the security state of the container images and take actions to fix issues identified during the scan

### Example vulnerability

Detect known vulnerabilities in the artifacts, e.g., in perl image, Integer Overflow or Wraparound (SNYK-DEBIAN10-PERL-570802)

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
AWS Config, AWS Inspector  

### Example vulnerability

exposed SSH service to brute force attacks
